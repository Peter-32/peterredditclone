ideas to possibly do:
  owner of a post
  admin user
  admin page
  delete page
  update page

  ban user
  add comments (foreign key to user and post)
  Add key binding on Atom software
  remove login into the url if possible



Done:
  signup has email address
  signup as firstname
  formatting the form with bootstrap
  basic login
  Make sure login checks for active field

Optional:
  advanced login (email login and require an email)
